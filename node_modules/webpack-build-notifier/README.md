# webpack-build-notifier

A [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) plugin that uses the [node-notifier](https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier) module to display OS-level notifications for Webpack build errors and warnings.

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack-build-notifier.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/webpack-build-notifier)

Are you tired of having to constantly switch between your IDE and terminal window to see whether your latest edits resulted in a failed build? Why didn't your latest changes get [hot-loaded](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)? Was there a syntax error or failed unit test? With this plugin, you will always be apprised of build problems without having to keep an eye on your terminal window.

To use, install the webpack-build-notifier package `npm install webpack-build-notifier --save-dev` and add the plugin to your [Webpack configuration file](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html):


```javascript
// webpack.config.js
var WebpackBuildNotifierPlugin = require('webpack-build-notifier');

module.exports = {
  // ... snip ...
  plugins: [
    new WebpackBuildNotifierPlugin({
      title: "My Project Webpack Build",
      logo: path.resolve("./img/favicon.png"),
      suppressSuccess: true
    })
  ],
  // ... snip ...
}
```

#### messageFormatter
A function which returns a formatted notification message. The function is passed two parameters:
* {Object} error/warning - The raw error or warning object.
* {String} filepath - The path to the file containing the error/warning (if available).

#### onClick
A function called when the notification is clicked. By default it activates the Terminal application.

Future Improvements

Notes
-----
After publishing this package I discovered a couple other similar plugins that are worth looking into:
* [webpack-notifier](https://github.com/Turbo87/webpack-notifier)
* [webpack-error-notification](https://github.com/vsolovyov/webpack-error-notification)

Given the purpose and similarities, this project probably should have been a fork of one of these.
